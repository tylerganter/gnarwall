					<description><![CDATA[I feel very pleased that you have visited Nepal and feel very bad that you were disappointed with Lumbini. Yes, we have not done enough in Lumbini that we can do and the work is going on to connect Lumbini through different routes. Lumbini development mega plan is now executed and i hope you will find it a better place in next visit. 
I am really happy that you are traveling Pokhara. Nepal is renowned for its beautiful mountains and beautiful people. Do not miss mountain trekking you will love it. We are working to make the South side of our country as beautiful as North side. 
Thanks for Visit!!]]></description>
